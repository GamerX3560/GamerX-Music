FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Could not determine the dependencies of task ':composeApp:mergeReleaseNativeLibs'.
> Could not resolve all dependencies for configuration ':composeApp:releaseRuntimeClasspath'.
   > Could not resolve project :media3.
     Required by:
         project :composeApp

* Try:
> Creating consumable variants is explained in more detail at https://docs.gradle.org/8.14.3/userguide/declaring_dependencies.html#sec:resolvable-consumable-configs.
> Review the variant matching algorithm at https://docs.gradle.org/8.14.3/userguide/variant_attributes.html#sec:abm_algorithm.
> Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace.
> Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.
> Run with --scan to get full insights.
